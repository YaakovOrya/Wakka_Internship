## Explanation of Code

### Predicting Salary Based on User Input

This code snippet is tasked with predicting the salary for a user's input of years of experience using a fitted linear regression model.

### Importing Libraries

The code imports the `numpy` library:

- **`import numpy as np`** : Imports the `numpy` library and assigns it the alias `np`. `numpy` is a popular library in Python for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Getting User Input

The code prompts the user to enter the number of years of experience using the `input()` function:

- **`years_input = float(input("Enter the number of years of experience:  "))`**: Prompts the user to enter the number of years of experience and converts the input to a float value.

### Making Prediction

Once the user input is obtained, the code predicts the salary based on the user's input using the fitted linear regression model:

- **`predicted_salary = model.predict(np.array([[years_input]]))`**: Uses the `predict()` method of the fitted linear regression model (`model`) to predict the salary for the user's input of years of experience. The input is converted to a numpy array and reshaped to match the model's input requirements.
- **`predicted_salary = predicted_salary[0].round(3)`**: Rounds the predicted salary to three decimal places for better readability.

### Displaying Prediction

Finally, the code prints the predicted salary for the user's input:

- **`print(f"Predicted salary for {years_input} years of experience is {predicted_salary} $")`**: Displays the predicted salary for the user's input of years of experience using f-string formatting.

### Purpose

The purpose of this code is to provide a predicted salary estimate based on the user's input of years of experience. It allows users to quickly obtain an estimate of their potential salary using the fitted linear regression model.
