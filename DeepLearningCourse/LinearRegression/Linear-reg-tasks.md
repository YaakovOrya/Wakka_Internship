# Tasks

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`), numerical operations (`numpy`), visualization (`matplotlib.pyplot`), and machine learning (`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`).

2. **Import the data**: Load the data from the provided CSV file into a DataFrame.

3. **Print a small part of the data**: Display a preview of the DataFrame to inspect its structure and contents.

4. **Plot the data**: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between years of experience and salary.

5. **Fit a linear regression model and plot the data with the regression line**: Use linear regression to fit a line to the data points and plot the regression line along with the scatter plot.

6. **Predict salary for user's input**: Prompt the user to input the number of years of experience and predict the corresponding salary using the trained linear regression model. Display the predicted salary to the user.
