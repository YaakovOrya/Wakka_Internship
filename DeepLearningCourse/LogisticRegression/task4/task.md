# Task: Initialize the Logistic Regression model + Fit the model to the entire dataset + Plot the logistic regression curve

1. **Initialize Logistic Regression Model**: Initialize a logistic regression model using scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` class.

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    ```

2. **Fit the Model to the Data**: Fit the logistic regression model to the entire dataset (`X` and `y`) using the `fit()` method. This step trains the model to learn the underlying patterns in the data.

    ```python
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    ```

3. **Plot Data Points**: Scatter plot the original data points (`X` and `y`) with blue color and label them as 'Data'.

    ```python
    plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data')
    ```

4. **Generate Predictions for Logistic Regression Curve**: Create evenly spaced x values (`x_values`) using NumPy's `linspace()` function, spanning the range of the original data. This is done to ensure that the logistic regression curve covers the entire range of the input feature `X` for visualization purposes. 

    ```python
    x_values = np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), 100)
    y_values = model.predict_proba(x_values.reshape(-1, 1))[:,1]
    ```

    The `linspace()` function generates 100 equally spaced points between the minimum and maximum values of the input feature `X`. These points are used as the x values for plotting the logistic regression curve. Using a sufficient number of points (in this case, 100) ensures that the curve appears smooth and covers the entire range of the data, providing a clear visualization of the relationship between the input feature and the probability of belonging to class 1.

5. **Plot Logistic Regression Curve**: Plot the logistic regression curve using the x and y values calculated in the previous step. The curve is plotted in red color and labeled as 'Logistic Regression'.

    ```python
    plt.plot(x_values, y_values, color='red', label='Logistic Regression')
    ```

6. **Set Plot Labels and Title**: Set labels for the x-axis and y-axis, and add a title to the plot.

    ```python
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Data with Logistic Regression Curve')
    ```

7. **Add Legend and Grid**: Add a legend to the plot to distinguish between the data points and the logistic regression curve. Enable grid lines for better visualization.

    ```python
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    ```

8. **Display the Plot**: Show the plot with the data points and the logistic regression curve.

    ```python
    plt.show()
    ```
