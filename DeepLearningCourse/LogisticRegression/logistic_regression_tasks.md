# Tasks

1. **Load the data**: Read the data from the provided CSV file into a DataFrame.

2. **Show the data frame**: Display the first few rows of the DataFrame to inspect its structure and contents.

3. **Split the data into features and target variable**: Separate the independent variable (features) 'x' from the dependent variable (target) 'y'.

4. **Plot the data without the logistic regression curve**: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the feature 'x' and the target 'y'.

5. **Initialize the Logistic Regression model, fit it to the entire dataset, and plot the logistic regression curve**: Train a logistic regression model using the feature 'x' and the target 'y', and plot the logistic regression curve to visualize the relationship between the feature and the probability of belonging to class 1.

6. **Predict the class for x = 14.23**: Predict the class label for a new input 'x = 14.23' using the trained logistic regression model and display the predicted class label.
