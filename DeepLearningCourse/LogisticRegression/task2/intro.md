## Explanation of Code

### Splitting the Data

This section of code splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y), preparing it for model training.

- **`X = df[['x']]`**: Extracts the feature 'x' from the DataFrame `df` and assigns it to the variable `X`.
- **`y = df['y']`**: Extracts the target variable 'y' from the DataFrame `df` and assigns it to the variable `y`.

### Purpose

The purpose of this code chunk is to separate the features and target variable from the dataset, facilitating the training of machine learning models.
