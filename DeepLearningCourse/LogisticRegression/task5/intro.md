## Explanation of Code

### Importing Libraries

- **`import numpy as np`**: This line imports the NumPy library as `np`. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays (like the one used in `new_x`), along with a broad collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Using `np` as an alias allows for shorter code when calling NumPy functions.

### Predicting the Class for a New Data Point

This code predicts the class for a new value of feature 'x' using the trained logistic regression model.

- **`new_x = np.array([[14.23]])`**: Creates a numpy array containing the new value of feature 'x'. The double brackets `[[ ]]` are used to create a two-dimensional array, which is required by many machine learning models, including logistic regression. This structure ensures that each row represents a separate data sample and each column represents a feature.

- **`predicted_class = model.predict(new_x)`**: Predicts the class label for the new value of 'x' using the trained logistic regression model.

- **`print(f"The predicted class for x = {new_x[0][0]} is: {predicted_class[0]}")`**: Prints the predicted class label for the new value of 'x'. The indexing `new_x[0][0]` is used to access the first element of the first row in the array `new_x`, effectively extracting the single feature value `14.23` for display.

### Purpose

This code chunk demonstrates how to use the trained logistic regression model to make predictions for new data points, allowing for classification of new observations.
