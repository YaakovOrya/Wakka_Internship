# Task: Predict the class for x = 14.23

This Markdown file provides a detailed explanation of the code's functionality, which predicts the class label for a new data point using a trained logistic regression model.

1. **Importing NumPy**: Import the NumPy library, which is essential for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with providing a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   ```

2. **Define New Data Point**: Create a new data point `new_x` as a NumPy array with the value 14.23. This is formatted as a 2D array to comply with the input requirements of scikit-learn's `predict()` method.

   ```python
   new_x = np.array([[14.23]])
   ```

3. **Predict Class**: Utilize the trained logistic regression model (`model`) to predict the class for the new data point using the `predict()` method.

   ```python
   predicted_class = model.predict(new_x)
   ```

4. **Print Prediction**: Output the predicted class for the input data point, providing insight into the classification result for the given feature value.

   ```python
   print(f"The predicted class for x = {new_x[0][0]} is: {predicted_class[0]}")
   ```

   - `{new_x[0][0]}` extracts the feature value from the `new_x` array.
   - `{predicted_class[0]}` retrieves the predicted class label from the `predicted_class` array.
