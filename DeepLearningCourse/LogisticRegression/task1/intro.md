## Explanation of Code

### Libraries Explanation:

- **`import pandas as pd`**: This imports the pandas library and aliases it as `pd`. Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data, such as tabular data, making it suitable for tasks like data cleaning, exploration, and transformation.


### Loading the Data

This section of code loads a dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. 

- **`file_path = "/Users/yaakovhaiby/Desktop/WakkaInternship/DeepLearnigCourse/LogisticReg/logreg_data.csv"`**: Specifies the file path where the CSV data is located.
- **`df = pd.read_csv(file_path)`**: Uses Pandas `read_csv()` function to read the CSV file into a DataFrame named `df`. This DataFrame holds the dataset for further processing.



### Displaying the DataFrame

This code chunk prints the first few rows of the DataFrame to provide an overview of the loaded dataset.

- **`print(df.head())`**: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame `df` using the `head()` function.

- **`print(df.shape)`**: This line of code prints the shape of the DataFrame, which is a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows, number of columns).


### Purpose

The purpose of this code is to inspect the structure and contents of the DataFrame, allowing the user to understand the data's format and contents. It also loads the dataset from a CSV file into memory, making it ready for subsequent data analysis and model training tasks.
